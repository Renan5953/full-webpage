# full-webpage

This is a simple project created as part of [The Odin Project] course.

## About the Project

The webpage presents a fictional gym and is structured into multiple sections: a hero section with the brand name and tagline, a services section outlining what the gym offers, a testimonial from a satisfied member, and a call-to-action block. It also includes a header and a footer for navigation and site information. The current version was built using only HTML and CSS, without any JavaScript.
